<p><i>n.b. Throughout the project we both pair programmed, solo programmed and sent snippets to one another via branches and discord, so the commits made to this project may not necessarily represent what code we have worked on i.e. sometimes we may have been a driver, sometimes a navigator and sometimes a solo programmer.</i></p>

<h2>Commands to run project</h2>

<li>npm run dev - runs dev environment locally</li>
<li>npm run build - creates dist file for build </li>
<li>npm run server - boots up local server</li>
</ul>
<h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>An app to help a user find a suitable street food stall on a market. The user can search by keyword for name, cuisine, featured menu items. Once filtered the user can select one stall to look at in more detail, to find opening hours, payment options and location on the market.</p>
<h2>Overall problem domain</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Current market map is static not interactive and the info is interactive but not location based, text based only. No online map, physical map in one location at the market.</li>  
<li>Currently one physical map, no option to update to reflect changing stalls, information becomes out of date quickly.
Customers find it difficult to identify rotating or seasonal specials due to localised menus.</li>
<li>Non-Norwich locals find it difficult to find information about Norwich market quickly as all information is scattered across multiple sources and is text based</li>
<li>Customers in a rush to get lunch find it difficult to find quick lunch options due to a mismatch in service times at peak service hours.</li>
<li>Different stalls have different or irregular opening hours making it uncertain for customers.</li>
<li>Norwich market has a food / shopping identify problem adding to the confusion that customers feel </li>
<li>Most customers only hear about good food stalls via word of mouth.â€¨</li>

<li>Stall owners are missing out on potential revenue due to out of date information and confused customer base.</li>
<li>Stall owners have to propagate up to date information across multiple platforms</li>
  
</ul>
